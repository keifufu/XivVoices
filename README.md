### Key Features:

1. **Expansive Coverage**: Voices all in-game dialogue, including NPC conversations, battle dialogue, narrator lines, and more.
2. **Lip Syncing**: Syncs NPCs' lip movements with their voiced dialogues for enhanced realism.
3. **Player Chat**: Implements voices for player messages using local TTS.
4. **Report System**: Every missing piece of dialogue gets reported automatically to be processed shortly after. Users can also manually report any dialogue they think should be redone for better quality.
5. **Always Voiced**: When a line isn't yet voiced, the plugin falls back to local TTS, the same used for chat messages.
6. **Customization**: We provide plenty of settings to customize what you want voiced and how!
